# Code Refactor Starter Code

There was a header element missing, it looked like div was used so I changed it to header

I am changing unecessary classifications (.) in the html header and the children elements and changing the CSS to not search for their classes as they are no longer classes at this stage

I do note that there aren't any notes to help explain any sections in the html or CSS that would help to organize the html or CSS properties for easy identifcation of changes to ther relevant sections.

In the header I replaced div with nav, so the li nav hyperlings are now within the parent box for smaller screens
